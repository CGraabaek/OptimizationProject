# Optimization Project
This is a project in the course Optimization and Data Analytics at Department of Engineering, Aarhus University.

## Data
For the project there are 2 different datasets:
- MNIST (Handwritten digits)
- ORL (Faces)

The MNIST data contains 10 classes, the digits from 0-9.
The ORL data contains 40 classes, of 40 different people.

## Methods used
5 different methods have been used: 

- Nearest Centroid Classifier
- Nearest sub-class centroid classifier using number of subclasses in the set {2,3,5}
- Nearest Neighbord Classifier
- Perceptron trained using Backpropagation
- Perceptron trained using MSE
